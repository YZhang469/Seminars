"""2025-09-22"""	"""Ziyi (Zoey) Zhang"""	"""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"""	"""Supporting Reproducibility and Transparency: Dataverse for Biomedical Data Reuse	Biomedical data is inherently complex, characterized by its fragmentation across diverse platforms, a lack of secure long-term archiving, inconsistent metadata standards, and limited accessibility for broader audiences. These characteristics create significant barriers to data sharing, hindering reproducibility and the effective reuse of valuable scientific information. To address these critical issues, this presentation will introduce a novel framework, Dataverse, which is designed to overcome these challenges. Dataverse aims to provide a central portal for discovering datasets and collections. It will facilitate metadata integration and reproducibility while ensuring secure storage and backup options. This talk will detail the framework's architecture and also demonstrate its application, showcasing a solution that enhances transparency and promotes the efficient reuse of biomedical data."""
