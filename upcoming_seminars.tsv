2025-09-08	Abhirath Anand	University of Michigan	BigRiverMetabolomics.jl: A Julia Package for Large-Scale Metabolomics Analysis	Metabolomics analysis provides a detailed snapshot of small molecules present in a biological system at a given instant.  It can be used to understand biological processes, diagnose disease, or understand response to environments.  Although there are well-established general workflows for analyzing metabolome data, there is still a lack of comprehensive, integrated software solutions that effectively streamline this process within the Julia software ecosystem. BigRiverMetabolomics.jl is an open-source Julia package designed as an end-to-end platform for metabolomics data analysis. It includes built-in modules for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization, facilitating rapid and reproducible exploration of large-scale datasets. This talk will present the package's architecture, outline the key design principles that guided its development, and demonstrate its application using a real-world metabolomics dataset.
2025-09-15	Se-Ran Jun, Ph.D.	University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences	Real Time Pathogen Surveillance: Translational Bioinformatics, Data Science, Biostatistics	Real-time pathogen surveillance is truly a transdisciplinary research area, combining microbiology, translational bioinformatics, data science, epidemiology, EHR, and some more. We are utilizing whole genome sequencing data as an epidemiology tool that provides detailed information about pathogens, and further data-rich understanding of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. Integration of genomic data into routine clinical practice offers new and promising opportunities to significantly improve patient outcomes, thus making hospitals safer. Success of this depends on key requirements: fast enough turnaround time, high discriminatory power, and high accuracy to impact antibiotic stewardship decision, to assist in breaking transmission routes, and to improve interventions made by infection prevention teams. Using clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium, a pathogen of high clinical consequence collected from patients at UAMS, we have demonstrated early success of our real-time genomic surveillance through a proof-of-concept model in supporting antibiotic stewardship. Further, our study underscores the importance and the benefits of integrating genomic data with EHR data for infection prevention and control.
