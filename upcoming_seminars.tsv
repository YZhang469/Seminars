2025-08-25	Arnab Aich	Florida State University	RMSTSS: A simple way to design clinical trials for time-to-event data	Analysis of time-to-event outcomes from clinical trials commonly uses the Cox proportional hazards model, which is problematic to understand or communicate if its underlying assumption of proportional hazards fails to hold. The Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) is a powerful and clinically interpretable alternative that gives a direct estimate of average event-free survival. Although recent statistical approaches have generalized direct modeling of RMST, there remains much demand for user-friendly software with which to design trials using those methodologies. The RMSTSS package consists of an all-encompassing solution to this need that was created to fill this gap by offering a powerful and flexible set of tools with which to calculate powers and sample sizes. The package contains many different contemporary approaches, such as direct linear models, multi-center stratified models and approaches to dependent censoring and non-linear covariate effect. Offering both speedy analytic and powerful bootstrap-based approaches, RMSTSS allows statisticians charged with designing trials and researchers to design trials quickly and accurately for complex situations at hand and thereby draw more interpretable and meaningful clinical conclusions.
2025-09-08	Abhirath Anand	University of Michigan	BigRiverMetabolomics.jl: A Julia Package for Large-Scale Metabolomics Analysis	Metabolomics analysis provides a detailed snapshot of small molecules present in a biological system at a given instant.  It can be used to understand biological processes, diagnose disease, or understand response to environments.  Although there are well-established general workflows for analyzing metabolome data, there is still a lack of comprehensive, integrated software solutions that effectively streamline this process within the Julia software ecosystem. BigRiverMetabolomics.jl is an open-source Julia package designed as an end-to-end platform for metabolomics data analysis. It includes built-in modules for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization, facilitating rapid and reproducible exploration of large-scale datasets. This talk will present the package's architecture, outline the key design principles that guided its development, and demonstrate its application using a real-world metabolomics dataset.
