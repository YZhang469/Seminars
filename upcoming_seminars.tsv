These characteristics create significant barriers to data sharing, hindering reproducibility and the effective reuse of valuable scientific information. To address these critical issues, this presentation will introduce a novel framework, Dataverse, which is designed to overcome these challenges. Dataverse aims to provide a central portal for discovering datasets and collections. It will facilitate metadata integration and reproducibility while ensuring secure storage and backup options. This talk will detail the framework's architecture and also demonstrate its application, showcasing a solution that enhances transparency and promotes the efficient reuse of biomedical data."""
2025-09-29	Shengqiang Chen	The University of Memphis	The Association Between Metabolomics and Sarcopenia Traits	Sarcopenia is a progressive, age-related condition characterized by the decline of muscle mass, strength, and function, and represents a major risk factor for physical frailty, loss of independence, increased hospitalization, and adverse health outcomes in older adults. As the global population ages, understanding the biological mechanisms underlying sarcopenia has become a critical public health priority. Metabolomics, an emerging field that enables comprehensive profiling of small-molecule metabolites, has advanced knowledge of the pathophysiology of numerous complex diseases. Recent metabolomics studies have begun to explore muscle-related phenotypes, revealing associations between specific metabolites and muscle mass. Building on these findings, the present study seeks to characterize the metabolomic signatures associated with key sarcopenia-related traits—muscle strength, muscle mass, and gait speed—and to uncover which metabolism may contribute to the development and progression of sarcopenia.
